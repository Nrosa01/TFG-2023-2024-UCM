== Motivation

Sand simulators were a prominent subgenre during the 1990s, and remained popular until the early 2000s. During that time, many programs and games emerged that allowed people to interact with virtual worlds filled with simulated particles. This attracted both simulation lovers and video game developers. However, after a period of relative calm, we are witnessing a renaissance of the genre thanks to video games like Noita or sandbox simulators like Sandspiel.

The objective of this Final Degree Project is to immerse ourselves in the world of sand simulators. We want to explore its different aspects and characteristics as well as better understand the advantages and disadvantages of different development approaches for the user, in order to contribute to its evolution and expansion, since we consider that it is a subgenre that can provide very good gaming and user experiences.

In short, we want to understand and help improve arena simulators to make them more useful and effective for users.

== Objectives

The main objective of this TFG is to study the behavior and ease of learning of different users using different implementations of sand simulators.

The functionality of each implementation will be assessed using the following parameters:

- Performance comparison: They will be compared under the same conditions, both at the hardware level and in the use of particles, measuring the final performance achieved. This performance will be compared using the ratio of number of particles / frames per second achieved. Ideally, you will find out the largest number of particles that each simulator can support while maintaining 60 fps.

- Comparison of usability: The behavior of a group of users will be studied to assess the ease of use and understanding of expansion systems that allow expansion by the user. The speed of completing a set of tasks will be assessed, as well as any possible misunderstandings they may have when using the system.

With these analyses, we aim to explore the characteristics that contribute to an optimal user experience in an arena simulator, both in terms of ease of use and expected performance of the system. By better understanding these characteristics, areas for improvement can be identified and recommendations developed to optimize the overall user experience with arena simulators.
