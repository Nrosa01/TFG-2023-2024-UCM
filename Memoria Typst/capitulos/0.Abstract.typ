Sand simulators, a subgenre of cellular automata, have experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years.However, we have identified a significant barrier that hinders its broader adoption among both users and developers, and this is the scarcity of background or available examples. Therefore, the aim of this project is to investigate various implementations of these simulators, evaluating their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their ability to be extended by any user, in order to increase the visibility and understanding of this subgenre.

To achieve this goal, the project will examine several implementations, both in terms of their execution on the CPU and a version that runs the logic on the GPU. Additionally, a study will be conducted with real users to identify potential issues with the implementations and assess the overall interest in the project. The results of these analyses will be used to draw conclusions and propose possible improvements for the project.
